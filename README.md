# Zuri-Task
This is a semantic Html 5 and CSS code on how to create a flex and grid layout.
It's a task give by the Zuri 14G training for us to understand more on how to create and style a grid and flex layout 

I appreciate all the mentors and all Zuri developers in general for giving us this great opportunity.
